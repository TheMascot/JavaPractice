//         ***LVL1***
//
//        Write a Java program that:
//        Continuously asks the user to enter an integer.
//        The loop must run at least once.
//
//                The program stops only when the user enters three even numbers in a row.
//                Negative numbers are allowed.
//                Zero counts as even.
//                When the loop ends, print:
//
//                "Program terminated after X inputs."
//                where X is the total number of numbers entered.
//
//        Rules:
//        You must use a do-while loop.
//        You may not use break.
//        You may not use continue.
//        You may not store all inputs (only counters / variables).



//         ***LVL2***
//
//          Write a Java program that:
//          Repeatedly asks the user to enter an integer.
//          The program must use a do-while loop.
//          The loop ends only when the user enters two numbers IN A ROW whose sum is divisible by 7.
//          Zero and negative numbers are allowed.
//          You may not use break, continue, arrays, or collections.
//
//          You may store only:
//          the current and previous number
//          counters / flags
//
//          When the loop ends, print:
//
//          "Program finished after X inputs."
//          where X is the total number of numbers entered.



//          ***LVL3***
//
//        Write a program that repeatedly asks the user to enter integers.
//        The program should stop only when ALL of the following are true at the same time:
//
//            The user has entered at least 5 numbers,
//            The last 3 numbers entered are strictly increasing,
//            The sum of all entered numbers so far is divisible by 10,
//            At least one negative number has been entered at any point.
//
//        When the program finishes, print:
//            how many numbers were entered,
//            the last 3 numbers,
//            the final sum.
//
//        Important constraints:
//            You must process inputs one by one (no arrays, no collections),
//            You may only keep the minimum necessary state,
//            The stopping condition must be checked in the loop condition (not with break).
